                Ontario homeowners can now take advantage of GreenON Rebates when making improvements to home energy efficiency. GreenON Rebates are available for insulation upgrades throughout the home - and the rebates are impressive - up to $7,200 for purchasing and installing insulation. GreenON Rebates are designed to offset the upfront cost of insulation upgrades. And the benefits to homeowners are measurable â€“ a well-insulated home can save 15% or more on heating the home in winter and cooling the home in summer. Year after year, the savings are substantial.
