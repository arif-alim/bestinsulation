            Every home consumes energy daily throughout the year. For the most part, a utility bill will show how much natural gas or electricity is being consumed every month. What’s more important is to understand how the energy is actually being consumed.

                Understanding the EnerGuide Ratings

                Understanding usage patterns help the homeowner to better conserve energy and therefore save on energy costs. This is exactly where the EnerGuide Rating System can be of value – it’s Step One in understanding personal energy consumption, and a turning point for making changes. A home’s “rating” summarizes the energy efficiency of the home, and identifies areas where efficiencies can be dramatically improved.

                Natural Resources Canada continues to work closely with industry partners (both public sector and private sector) to update and improve the existing EnerGuide Rating Scale. The new system, based on an annual Gigajoule Rating, will gauge energy consumption in “gigajoules/year”, a much-improved rating scale that is already in place in Ontario.
              %p.content
                The EnerGuide rating system is designed to express the energy performance of a home. In basic terms, EnerGuide estimates the net amount of energy consumed annually in a home. To attain a reliable rating, a number of steps are required:  first, an accredited Home Energy Advisor gathers relevant data on-site; second, all of the collected data and information is entered into NRCan’s energy simulation software; and third, a profile and rating are processed and documented.

                Importantly, NRCan is focused on a home’s energy performance - not on occupant behavior. This allows a rating to accurately compare energy use between one home and another. In fact, the rating is not intended reflect home energy consumption as shown on a utility bill. In the bigger picture, EnerGuide home evaluations and ratings help homeowners to better understand energy performance, energy consumption, and the prospect of reducing greenhouse gases day-to-day.
